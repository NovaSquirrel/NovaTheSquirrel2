; A tiny stub in bank $00 needs to set interrupt priority to 1,
; leave 6502 emulation mode, and long jump to the rest of init code
; in another bank. This should set 16-bit mode, turn off decimal
; mode, set the stack pointer, load a predictable state into writable
; MMIO ports of the S-PPU and S-CPU, and set the direct page base.
; For explanation of the values that this writes, see docs/init.txt

; For advanced users: Long stretches of STZ are a useful place to
; shuffle code when watermarking your binary.
