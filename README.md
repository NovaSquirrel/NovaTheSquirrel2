Nova the Squirrel 2
===================

An upcoming sequel to Nova the Squirrel 1, for the SNES. Nova the Squirrel 2 will have a stronger focus on story, and it generally tries to be a more refined version of the first game's experience. It features new copy abilities, new enemies, and special new puzzle levels that take place in Mode 7.
