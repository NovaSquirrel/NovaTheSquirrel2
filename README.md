Nova the Squirrel 2
===================

An upcoming sequel to Nova the Squirrel 1, for the SNES.

Some parts based on [LoROM template](https://github.com/pinobatch/lorom-template)

The corresponding level editor is [Princess Edit 2](https://github.com/NovaSquirrel/PrincessEdit2).

Building
========

You'll need the following:

* Python 3 (and Pillow)
* GNU Make
* [ca65](https://cc65.github.io/)
* [Huffmunch](https://github.com/bbbradsmith/huffmunch) compressor (Windows build included)

With that in place, just enter `make`.

All game and tool code is available under GPL version 3.

Ask before using any art in anything else.
Generally, fan works (like romhacks with new levels) are okay, whereas using it as stock art is not.
