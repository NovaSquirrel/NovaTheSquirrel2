W-what's that? The ground's at
some sort of angle? You can DO
that?
{-}
{Say 0 Maffi 2}
Yes Nova that's called a "slope."
I understand Latte didn't have them?
{-}
{Say 1 Nova 5}
There were sloped minecart tracks
but no sloped ground. I've never
seen anything like this before.
{-}
{Say 0 Maffi 0}
Well, in this world, ground can be
sloped too! You can even roll down
the hill if you press {arrowdown} + {buttonb} on it.
